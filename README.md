<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users can view lumin8 members on the home page.</li>
<li>Users can click a lumin8 profile name to learn more about the member.</li>
<li>User can delete the lumin8 member from database.</li>
<li>User can add a new lumin8 profile to the database.</li>
<li>User can edit lumin8 member profile.</li>
<li>Users can view only 20 profiles per page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>In the future I plan to add a search bar for users to search via profile tags. I also want to change the page to only list five profiles as 20 is a bit much. I want to make the site a bit more mobile-friendly. I also want to make the tags checkbox to help better define the content submitted. I want to add a sign in and sign out function to make the site data secure so users cant just delete or update a random profile. </p>
